We should not eat or drink at the computers and should always clean up after ourselves because these rules help protect our technology, keep our classroom clean, and teach us responsibility.
First, eating or drinking near computers can easily cause damage. If a drink spills on a keyboard or computer, it can short-circuit the system and cost a lot of money to repair or replace. Even small crumbs can get stuck in keyboards or attract pests, which can make the classroom dirty and unpleasant. Second, when students leave trash or food behind, it creates extra work for the teacher and custodians. A messy classroom can distract others and make it harder for everyone to focus on learning. Keeping the room clean shows respect for the shared space and for the people who use it after us.
These rules matter because they help us build good habits that we will need in the future. In most workplaces, eating or drinking near expensive equipment is not allowed, and employees are expected to clean up after themselves. Following these expectations now prepares us for those environments. It also shows responsibility and respect for our classmates and teachers. When everyone follows the rules, the classroom stays organized, safe, and welcoming for everyone.

A job that uses drones is a drone programmer. They’re the ones who write the code that tells drones how to fly, avoid obstacles, and complete missions like deliveries or taking photos. According to Indeed, drone programmers in Texas make around $85,000 a year, which is pretty awesome. Most of them need a Part 107 license from the FAA and should know programming languages like Python or C++. They also have to understand sensors and GPS systems so the drones don’t crash. It sounds like a cool job if you’re into tech and flying gadgets, but honestly, I don’t think I’d want to do it. Sitting at a computer coding all day just isn’t my thing—I’d rather be out actually flying the drones.

I believe technology has changed the way people celebrate and connect during the holidays by making it easier to stay in touch, even from far away. Video calls, social media, and messaging apps allow families and friends to share moments instantly, no matter where they are. For example, grandparents can watch their grandchildren open gifts through a video chat, which keeps traditions alive despite distance. This makes the holidays better because it helps people feel closer and more included. However, constant notifications and screen time can sometimes distract from real-life interactions. That’s why I think developers should be responsible for ensuring holiday tech respects privacy and family time. By designing products that encourage balance and protect personal data, they can help families enjoy the best parts of both technology and togetherness.

When the SNAP program runs out of funding, many families who rely on it to buy groceries struggle to afford healthy food. This is a big problem because it affects low-income households, children, and seniors who depend on these benefits for daily meals. Technology could help by connecting people to local food banks, community kitchens, or grocery stores that offer discounts or free meal programs. For example, an app could show nearby food resources and update in real time when supplies are available. However, challenges might include limited internet access, lack of smartphones, or privacy concerns for users sharing personal information. If I were the designer, I would create an app called FoodLink, which would map out nearby food resources, allow users to schedule pickups, and send alerts when new food assistance options become available.

The technology rules focus on using devices the right way to help us learn more and keep us from getting distracted. Cell phones must stay in assigned spots during class, but Chromebooks are the main tools for all school work and research. We won't ban AI tools like ChatGPT; instead, we'll learn to use them correctly in our classes for better writing and critical thinking. All purely fun games, competitive sites, and social media will be blocked during school hours so everyone can focus. However, learning games for subjects like math or coding will be allowed during independent study periods. These steps will make school better by helping us learn deeply, teaching us essential AI skills, and turning our devices into useful tools instead of big distractions.

The phrase “6, 7” is a strange little code students toss around. Nobody really agrees on what it means. Some think it’s just a way to sound funny in the middle of class. Others believe it started as an inside joke that spread through the halls. The mood feels playful, not serious. Saying it lightens the moment. Maybe people keep repeating it because mystery itself is fun. Its dumb

4.The US security argument against TikTok starts with the simple concern that large amounts of user data could end up in China, where it could ultimately fall into the hands of the country's ruling Communist party.
This measure unnecessarily restricts the right to freedom of expression, which includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information. Rather than applying arbitrary bans, US authorities should introduce regulations that govern all tech platforms to protect everyone's human rights in the digital age.
